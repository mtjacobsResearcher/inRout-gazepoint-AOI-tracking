# inRout-gazepoint-AOI-tracking
This script was written to track via Gazepoint eye tracking data whether participants were looking within a fixation circle during a task. The output of the script was the percentage of time per trial a participant was looking at the center fixation cricle. Research assistants recorded start time of trials by viewing video recordings of reach trial and navigating frame by frame for most precise estimate. Participant gaze did not significantly impact task performance.
